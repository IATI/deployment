# IATI Deployment Documentation

This complements the existing Google Doc `IATI Deployment Info` which is stored (until a time that all deployment information has been migrated here) on the IATI team Google drive.

Notes on writing deployment documentation
- **Be aware of documentation decay!**
  - Try not to name specific variables/configurations that are also defined in the Ansible code.
  - Let the deployment code do the talking, as this reduces the documentation maintenance burden
- Where a named member of the team can give access, suggest cite at least two people  - e.g. Speak to Person X or Person Y for the password. This reduces single points of failure, especially where people are not available.
- Donâ€™t forget that the deployment docs are public documents, so don't reveal any secrets!
